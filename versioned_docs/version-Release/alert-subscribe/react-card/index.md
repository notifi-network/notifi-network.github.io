## Design Guidelines

We provide design recommendations to help you present the UI effectively to your dApp users. Check them out here: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/GotqBWyzrRKbZpSmMeouer/Notification-Card---External-File?node-id=1795-3876&p=f&t=V2qGuMvlIXJeK41Q-0)

#### Tips

- Embed the bell icon near the wallet login section for better visibility and user experience:

- There should be a state for the bell icon when connected/not connected:

- Make sure that there is enough contrast between color selections.

- Styling should be consistent with your current UI.
