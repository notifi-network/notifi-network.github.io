üîó For a detailed walkthrough, check out this [Figma guide](https://www.figma.com/proto/EDRHnzmXsLRrmM1VBc57Hw/Notifi-Slides?page-id=3859%3A1161&type=design&node-id=10175-1378&viewport=633%2C494%2C0.12&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=3859%3A1287)

The Notifi Admin Panel empowers teams to efficiently manage notifications, optimize engagement, and analyze user interactions with minimal complexity. 

<!-- üìå **Note**: In order to use the **Community Manager** and send alerts, you need to set up notification **topic** and configure **signup card**. Additionally, a user must sign up for the topic to receive notifications, which you'll learn later in the [Getting Started section](../../getting-started.md). -->

<!-- 1. Navigate to the [**Community Manager**](https://admin.notifi.network/community) page in Admin Portal.
2. Click the "**+ Compose**" button.
3. Under **Audience/Notification Topic**, select the Community Manager
   topic you created.
4. Enter a name in the **Campaign Name** field. Your audience won't
   see this name - it's just used to uniquely identify the message
   for [reporting](../../reporting/reporting.md).
5. Choose where you want to send the notification (e.g., Email, Telegram, Discord).
   - **Alert History** is always selected.
6. Enter a subject and message for your notification.
7. (Optional) Schedule the notification to be sent at a later time.
8. Click the **Publish** button at the bottom.
   - Within a few moments, you should receive an email at the address you provided to your Notifi card.
   - You should also see the message in the Notifi card's Inbox screen! -->
