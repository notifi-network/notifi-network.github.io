# Create Smart Links

## About Smart Link
Smart Links offer easily configurable UI components, allowing developers and businesses to integrate blockchain interactions seamlessly into their platforms. To start using Smart Links, configure your UI components on Admin Portal and write a parser function that composes the blockchain transaction.

## Get Started
1. Create an account on [Admin Portal](https://admin.notifi.network) and head to the Smart Links tab.
2. Create a smart link
3. Configure your UI components
4. Write a parser function that composes the blockchain transaction
5. Use your smart link!

## Create your first smart link
In this example, we will be creating a smart link that allows users to tip your wallet.

### Configuring your UI components
Configure your smart link UI components based on your use case. Notifi's Admin Portal makes it simple to compose your components.

#### Step 1
Upon creating a new smart link, fill out the initial details of your smart link. Note that banner image, title, and subtitle are optional.

#### Step 2
Choose different inputs for your smart link. In this example, we will be using a text input with min / max constraints. You can add as many inputs as you want. You can also add additional actions, images, and text.

#### Step 3
Select the target blockchain network for your users' transactions.

Now you're set to write your parser for your smart link! You can preview the smart link UI at any time on the Admin Portal. To begin parser development, click on the "Continue Development" button. Paste the command to your terminal and follow the .README instructions.

Once you've finished writing your parser, return to the Admin Portal, click "Copy Link", and go to the copied url to view your live smart link.
