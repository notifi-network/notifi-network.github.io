# Getting Started

In this Getting Started guide, we will walk through the steps of creating
a Dapp account with Notifi, setting up a notification topic, signup card, and allowing users
to subscribe to that topic. By the end of this guide, you will be able to send your first message!

## Signing Up For Notifi

To sign up your Dapp for Notifi,
[create an account](https://admin.notifi.network/signup) on the
[Notifi Admin Portal](https://admin.notifi.network).

<!-- TODO: Screenshots -->

Once you've set your email address, password, and company name, expect
a verification email for that email address. Once you verify your email,
you can then log into Admin Portal and begin setting up notifications!

## Setting Up A Notification Topic

The first step is to define notification topics that users can subscribe to. A topic is a category of alerts tailored for a specific use case or user group, ensuring relevant and meaningful notifications.

Notifi has three types of notifications:

1. Messages written in Community Manager in Admin Portal
2. Messages triggered by your server through the Notifi SDK
3. Messages triggered by Notifi-hosted code, usually in response to on-chain events

ðŸ“Œ For a more in-depth understanding of different topic types and their use cases, please refer to the following resources:
ðŸ”— [Topics in Detail](https://docs.notifi.network/docs/integration-overview/alerts-in-depth)

For this Getting Started guide, we will be creating a Community Manager topic.
Check out our
[self-hosted](https://docs.notifi.network/docs/getting-started-with-self-hosted)
and [Notifi-hosted](https://docs.notifi.network/docs/next/getting-started-with-notifi-hosted)
guides for writing for the other two types.

To create a Community Manager topic, go to the Alert Manager, click **Create Topic**,
then **Send announcements from Community Manager**.
In the dialog box that appears, set the name of your topic and click Create.
[Example here](https://docs.notifi.network/docs/create-topics/announcements)

## Setting Up Your Signup UI

The easiest way to set up signup UI for your users is the [Notifi React Card](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@notifi-network/notifi-react), a
React component that you can integrate with your application. This has two steps:
creating the UI Card config in Admin Portal, and adding the card to your application.

### Creating a UI Card Config

To create your UI card configuration, go to the **UI Config** tab in Alert Manager,
then click **Create UI Card**.

<!-- TODO: Screenshots -->

You'll be presented with the Edit UI Card screen, which will let you edit your card
and show you a preview.

1. Enter a name for your card.
2. Set the wallet type that you want to use to connect to the card. For this example,
   we will use Ethereum (though the instructions will be the same for any EVM chain).
   - Note that each card config only supports one wallet at a time. If you want to allow
     signups across multiple blockchains, create a separate card for each.
3. Click **Select Topics**, then on the dialog box that pops up, click the check box
   next to the Community Manager topic you created earlier. Click Save to put the
   Edit UI Card back in focus.
4. If you wish, add a tooltip to your topic by clicking the **Add Tooltip** button.
   In the dialog box that appears, type a short note to explain your topic.
5. Under **Destinations**, click the switches next to the destination types you want
   to enable. For this Getting Started guide, we will just activate "Email", as that
   requires the least setup.
6. Click **Save Card** in the top right corner of the screen.

You're all done! Leave this page open so that you can reference the **Card ID** when
you add the card to your application.

ðŸ”— Check out the [Card Configuration Guide Example](https://docs.notifi.network/docs/alert-subscribe/react-card/create-card-id) for a detailed walkthrough with screenshots.

Additionally, to enable notification destinations like Telegram and Discord, and to add your own custom email domain for sending notifications to your user base, refer to this guide:
ðŸ”— [Notification Destinations Setup](https://docs.notifi.network/docs/category/setting-up-targets)

## Setting Up a React Application With Your Card

Now that we have a card config, we'll go through the process of adding it to a
React application.

> Looking for more in-depth knowledge on our [React Card](https://github.com/notifi-network/notifi-sdk-ts/blob/main/packages/notifi-react/README.md)?

:::note

This example will be using Ethereum. Setting up the React card for a different EVM
chain only requires changing the chain name, but setting up the React card for different chains
requires different boilerplate for each. Check out the
[Notifi React card SDK](https://github.com/notifi-network/notifi-sdk-ts/tree/main/packages/notifi-react)
for examples of how to use the React card with other chains.

:::

First, either open your existing React or Next.js project, or
[create a new one](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project).

#### Installing the Correct Packages:

_Environment_

- Node version >= 18 (with corresponding npm version)
- React version >= 17"

_Packages_  

 - [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@notifi-network/notifi-react) - [@notifi-network/notifi-react]((https://www.npmjs.com/package/@notifi-network/notifi-react))

#### Implement The Card:

With the card configuration set up, the next step is to integrate the [Notifi React Card](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@notifi-network/notifi-react) into your React application

ðŸ“Œ Design Guidance: We provide design recommendations in our [Figma Guide](https://www.figma.com/design/GotqBWyzrRKbZpSmMeouer/Notification-Card---External-File?node-id=1795-3876&p=f&t=V2qGuMvlIXJeK41Q-0) to help you effectively present the UI within your dApp. However, the visual implementation remains fully flexible, allowing you to customize it to match your design preferences.

##### Mount the `NotifiCardModal` to your dApp

> **IMPORTANT:** To use `NotifiCardModal`, you need to wrap your component with `NotifiContextProvider` first.
>
> _Example Quick Start for Ethereum_

```tsx
import {
  NotifiContextProvider,
  NotifiCardModal,
} from '@notifi-network/notifi-react';
import { useEthers } from '@usedapp/core';
import { providers } from 'ethers';

// Import the default Notifi styles for proper UI rendering
import '@notifi-network/notifi-react/dist/index.css';

const NotifiCard = () => {
  const { account, library } = useEthers();
  const signer = useMemo(() => {
    if (library instanceof providers.JsonRpcProvider) {
      return library.getSigner();
    }
    return undefined;
  }, [library]);

  if (account === undefined || signer === undefined) {
    // account is required
    return null;
  }

  return (
    // tenantId and cardId are found on the Notifi Admin Portal.
    <NotifiContextProvider
      tenantId="YOUR_TENANT_ID" // dApp ID
      cardId="YOUR_CARD_ID" // Card ID
      env="Production"
      signMessage={signMessage}
      walletBlockchain="ETHEREUM"
      walletPublicKey={account}
    >
      <NotifiCardModal darkMode={true} />
    </NotifiContextProvider>
  );
};
```

## Subscribe to your card

Now, run your dAPP locally and subscribe to the card in the respective render!

ðŸ”— For a complete working example and best practices, check out our [Example Integration Repository.](https://github.com/notifi-network/notifi-sdk-ts/tree/main/packages/notifi-react-example-v2)

Below are screenshots demonstrating how your card UI will look during the subscription process. You can sign up, subscribe to topics, and check notifications inside the cardâ€™s inbox section.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "space-around", flexWrap: "wrap", gap: "5px", marginBottom:"10px" }}>
  <img src="/img/card-signup/1.png" width="24%" />
  <img src="/img/card-signup/2.png" width="24%" />
  <img src="/img/card-signup/3.png" width="24%" />
  <img src="/img/card-signup/4.png" width="24%" />
</div>


## Sending Your First Message

Finally, now that we have a topic and a user signed up to it,
it's time to send a message!

1. Navigate to the [**Community Manager**](https://admin.notifi.network/community) page in Admin Portal.
2. Click the "**+ Compose**" button.
3. Under **Audience/Notification Topic**, select the Community Manager
   topic you created.
4. Enter a name in the **Campaign Name** field. Your audience won't
   see this name - it's just used to uniquely identify the message
   for [reporting](./reporting).
5. Choose the destinations for your message.
   - **Alert History** is always selected.
   - In this example, we'll also add **Email**.
6. In the Alert History section, enter the subject and message you want to send.
7. Copy the subject and message into the Email section. (Here, you can add extra details and formatting, such as lists or images.)
8. Click the **Publish** button at the bottom.
   - Within a few moments, you should receive an email at the address you provided to your Notifi card.
   - You should also see the message in the Notifi card's Inbox screen!

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "space-around", marginBottom:"30px" }}>
  <img src="/img/card-signup/5.png" width="30%" />
  <img src="/img/card-signup/6.png" width="30%" />
</div>

of the available parameters, check out [this guide](./alert-subscribe/react-card).

To learn more about using the Frontend client, which allows deeper integration
of Notifi functionality, check out [this guide](./alert-subscribe/frontend-client). -->

### Event-Triggered Notifications

In addition to sending messages manually using Community Manager,
notifications can also be triggered based on events, both to your general audience and to specific
destinations. Notifi offers two separate avenues for this - notifications from
self-hosted services through the Notifi SDK, and notifications from custom code hosted
on Notifi's servers that follow on-chain events. Check out the quickstart guides
for these:

- [Getting Started With Self-Hosted API Notifications](https://docs.notifi.network/docs/getting-started-with-self-hosted)
- [Getting Started With Notifi-Hosted Development](https://docs.notifi.network/docs/next/getting-started-with-notifi-hosted)

### Adding Additional Destination Platforms

Notifi notifications can be delivered through email, Telegram, Discord, Slack,
and more. A few of these platforms require you to supply a bot for Notifi to use.
It is also possible to send email via your own custom domain:

- [Set up a Telegram bot](./target-setup/tg-bot)
- [Set up a Discord bot](./target-setup/discord-bot)
- [Set up a Slack integration](./target-setup/slack-integration)
- [Set up a custom email domain](./target-setup/email-domain)

### Style Your Notifications

Notifications can also be templated and styled. Check out our
[template guide](./styling-your-notifications/)!

### Set Up Custom Notification UI

The React Card is the simplest way to set up UI for signing up for notifications,
but a more comprehensive frontend client is also available. Check out
[our guide for integrating it](./alert-subscribe/frontend-client)!
